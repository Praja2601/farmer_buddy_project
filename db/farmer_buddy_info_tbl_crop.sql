INSERT INTO `tbl_crop` VALUES (1,'Sugarcane','1','/IMG/crops/sugarcane.jpg','Sugarcane is able to grow over a prolonged season. Under warm humid conditions, it can continue its growth, unless terminated by flowering. Temperatures above 50o C arrest its growth; those below 20 o C slow it down markedly and severe frost proves fatal. The crop does best in the tropical regions receiving a rainfall of 750-1200mm. For ripening, it needs a cool, dry season; but where rainfall is too heavy and prolonged, the quality of the juice tends to be low, and where the weather remains comparatively.','Depending upon the variety and sowing time it takes about 12 to 18 months to mature. In general January to march is the period of planting and December to March is the period of harvesting. In some states sugarcane is grown round the year. After harvest, generally a ratoon crop is cultivated from the regrowth. In some countries 2-6 ratoons are allowed. In Maharashtra and Karnataka sugarcane is planted in three different seasons. land-Sugarcane remains in the field for about 2 to 3 years due to the practice of raising one or two ratoon crops. Therefore a thorough soil preparation once in 2 to 3 years is absolutely essential. About 45 cm depth of the soil should be well prepared since 75% of the sugarcane root system is present at this soil layer. An ideal soil condition is one in which there is 50% soil particles (45% mineral matter + 5% organic matter), 25% air and 25% water. The soil preparation should aim at achieving near ideal condition.','Sugarcane grows best on medium heavy soils, but can also be raised on lighter soils and heavy clays, provided there is adequate irrigation available in the former type of soils and drainage is good in the latter type of soils. In many places, dark rich clay loams, 120-150cm deep, and lying on a previous substratum of murum (distintegrated traprock) ae used for this crop. In some areas','','Planting of sugarcane is done in three seasons that is suru- January-February, adsali - July-August and pre seasonal- October-November for planting generally ridges and furrows are prepared on 100-120cm spacing. For planting one hectare area 25-30 thousand three eye buded cane setts are required.','Water requirement of sugarcane varies from 2000 to 2500 mm depending upon its duration, soil type and climatological factors. For sugarcane germination, tillering, grand growth and maturity are the critical stages for irrigation. During germination phase (1-35 days) there should be enough moisture in the soil for better germination but waterlogging is undesirable as it leads to rotting of setts. During this period irrigation can be scheduled at weekly intervals. But irrigation at 10 days interval during tillering stage (36-100 days) is sufficient. The formative and grand growth stages (101-270 days) are the critical stages for water demand. During this period irrigation can be practised at weekly intervals. At the maturity phase (271 days to harvest) fortnightly irrigation is enough. Irrigation will have to be stopped at 15 days prior to harvest.','Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is the main sources of sugar in India and holds a prominent position as a cash crop. India is the world’s largest consumer and the second largest producer of sugar, topped only by Brazil. Nearly 2.8 lakh farmers have been cultivating sugarcane in the vast area of 4.4 lakh acres and over 11 crore people are directly or indirectly dependent on the sugar industry in the country. Sugarcane is one of the important commercial crops of India, grown in an area of 3.93 m.ha with annual production of 170 M.T. Sugarcane productivity in India is around 67 t/ha. It is one of the most important food-cum-cash crops grown in the country, providing employment to a larger number of people, in addition to earning considerable foreign exchange.','Studies have shown the main sugarcane nutrient requirements are nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, sulfur and silicon. The exact amounts of these nutrients depend upon your soil, but at least it’s a place to start. The soil pH will affect the plant’s ability to absorb and added nutrients and must be 6.0 to 6.5 for optimal results. Other factors will affect the exact amount of nutrient absorbed, such as heavy soil, which can minimize uptake of nitrogen. As a grass, the number one nutrient necessary when fertilizing sugarcane is nitrogen. Just as with your lawn, sugarcane is a heavy nitrogen user. Nitrogen should be applied at 60 to 100 pounds per acre (27 to 45 kilos/.40 ha). The lower amount is for lighter soil while the higher amount is in heavy soils. Phosphorus is the other macronutrient sugarcane fertilizer should contain. The recommended amount is 50 pounds per acre (23/.40 ha). A soil test to pinpoint the actual rate is essential because excess phosphorus can cause rust.'),(2,'Cotton','2','/IMG/crops/cotton2.jpg','Cotton is a tropical and subtropical crop. For the successful germination of its seeds, a minimum temperature of 15o C is required. The optimum temperature range for vegetative growth is 21 o - 27 o C. It can tolerate temperatures as high as 43 oC, but does not do well if the temperature falls below 21 oC. During the period of fruiting, warm days and cool nights with large diurnal variations are conducive to good boll and fibre development.','Cotton is a Kharif crop which requires 6 to 8 months to mature. Its time of sowing and harvesting differs in different parts of the country depending upon the climatic conditions. It is sown in April-May and is harvested in December-January that is before the winter frost can damage the crop.','In cotton selection on of soil is very important. Cotton is grown on a variety of soils. Soil should be black medium to deep (90cm) having good drainage availability. Cotton does not tolerate water-logging condition. It is grown mainly as a dry crop in the black cotton and medium black soil. Irrigated cotton is taken in the alluvial soils.','Cotton is sown on ridges and furrows. For irrigated cotton the land is given a deep ploughing followed by two harrowings. Ridges and furrows having different spacing for irrigated and rainfed cotton. For irrigated cotton shallow ridges on 90cm spacing should be prepared which helps in irrigation. According to slope of land, length of ridges should be 6-9m.','Seed treatment of fungicides should be given 3 gram per kg of cotton seed. Also seed treatment with biofertilizers viz. Azobacter, Azospirillum, and Phosphorous Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) 25 gram per kg of seeds. For seed treatment a paste of fungicides/biofertilizer should be prepared enough thick, which cover the seeds and these seeds dried in shade. After completely dried seeds should be used for sowing. Before sowing soil should be irrigated and after wapsa condition sowing should be done. Small shallow holes should be prepared on middle of the ridge upto 2-3 inch deep and applied recommended fertilizers and 1.0-1.5 gram of thimet and cover it with the soil. On each hill 3-4 cotton seeds should be dibble and cover completely with the soil and apply irrigation immediately.','In case of cotton germination, square initiation, flowering and boll formation and boll development are the critical stages for irrigation. The irrigated cotton crop is mostly sown after a preliminary irrigation and second the light watering is given in three or four days after germination. Subsequent watering depends upon the nature of the soil and the weather conditions. Flowering and boll formation are the critical stages from the point of view of irrigation. The summer sown crop gets frequent irrigations at intervals of 8-12 days. From sowing to square initiation period over irrigation should be avoided to stop the excessive vegetative growth. Skip row method should be followed if there is less availability of water. For first interval of irrigation water should be applied in first, third, fifth row and second interval water should be applied in second, fourth and sixth row.','Cotton, one of the world’s leading agricultural crops, is plentiful and economically produced, making cotton products relatively inexpensive. The fibres can be made into a wide variety of fabrics ranging from lightweight voiles and laces to heavy sailcloths and thick-piled velveteens, suitable for a great variety of wearing apparel, home furnishings, and industrial uses. Cotton fabrics can be extremely durable and resistant to abrasion. Cotton accepts many dyes, is usually washable, and can be ironed at relatively high temperatures. It is comfortable to wear because it absorbs and releases moisture quickly. When warmth is desired, it can be napped, a process giving the fabric a downy surface. Various finishing processes have been developed to make cotton resistant to stains, water, and mildew; to increase resistance to wrinkling, thus reducing or eliminating the need for ironing; and to reduce shrinkage in laundering to not more than 1 percent. ','As a first rule of thumb, cotton plant consumes Nitrogen (N) at a double quantity compared to Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K). Consequently, a N-P-K 20-10-10 fertilizer is more suitable, if a soil analysis is impossible. A common fertilization schedule applied by many cotton growers is adding 440 lbs. (200 kg) of N-P-K 20-10-10 per hectare during sowing (through the sowing machine), and 440 lbs. (200 kg) of N-P-K 20-10-10 per hectare during flowering (early summer). Keep in mind that 1 hectare = 10.000 square meters = 2,47 acres. Another common fertilization scheme is adding 550 lbs. (250 kg) of ammonium nitrate, 400 lbs. (181 kg) of N-P-K 0-46-0 and 400 lbs. (181 kg) of N-P-K 0-0-50 per hectare throughout the year. These quantities are normally spread in 8 equal applications, with the first being after sowing and the last around 6 weeks after flowering.'),(3,'Jute and Mesta','2','/IMG/crops/mesta.jpg','It requires temperature  25 degree C – 30 degree C. Rainfall 60 to 90 cm. Sowing temperature 25 degree C – 28 degree C and Harvesting temperature 20 degree C – 25 degree C.','May - June is optimum time for sowing of mesta crop.','Mesta can be grown on variety of soil. It gives best result when grown on rich loamy soils. Acidic soil and waterlogging soils are not suitable for Mesta cultivation. It can be grown on soils having pH 4.5-7.8',': Ploughed land thoroughly before monsoon to bring soil to fine tilth. After ploughing, make soil weed and stubble free. Then levelled soil properly. Add 2-4ton/acre of well decomposed cow dung at time of field preparation.','May - June is optimum time for sowing of Mesta crop.','It is rainfed crop so it doesn’t required irrigation. If needed provide irrigation depending upon weather condition and soil type.','Mesta is herbaceous annual plant. It is an important commercial crop after cotton and Jute. Its origin lies in Afro-Asian countries. Stem or bark of plant is used for fibre production. Hibiscus cannabinus and Hibiscus sabdariffa are two species commonly name as Mesta. Hibiscus Sabdariffa is drought resistant variety where as in areas of rainfall of 50-90 mm canabiscus grow well as it is short duration variety. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Meghalaya, Karnataka and Tripura are major mesta growing states.','For higher yield, apply Nitrogen 16kg/acre, Phosphorus 8kg/acre and Potash 8kg/acre in form of Urea 36kg/acre, SSP 50kg/acre and MOP 14kg/acre. Apply whole quantity of Phosphorus and Potash fertilizer and 1/3rd quantity of Nitrogen fertilizer at time of sowing. Apply remaining quantity of Nitrogen in two equal splits, first 21 days after sowing and second on 35 days after sowing at time of weeding operations.'),(4,'Wheat','3','/IMG/crops/wheat.jpg','Wheat is a widely adaptable crop that can be grown in climates ranging from temperate to tropical and cold northern parts. Places with a cool, moist weather for most part of the year followed by a short, dry and warm spell is most suited for wheat cultivation. This type of weather condition permits appropriate maturing and ripening of grains. However, areas with heavy rainfall, moist and warm climate are not suited for commercial wheat farming. Similarly, drought-like conditions, extremely low or high temperatures during the flowering stage would affect the wheat crop. During high temperature, a lot of energy is lost owing to transpiration. Hence, there is very little residual energy left within the crop resulting in low yields. High humidity and low temperature are likely to induce rust attack on the crops.','Wheat is a Rabi crop that is grown in the winter season. Sowing of wheat takes place in October to December and harvesting is done during the months of February and May. The wheat crop needs cool winters and hot summers, which is why the fertile plains of the Indo-Gangetic region are the most conducive for growing it.','Wheat needs soil with a moderate amount of water holding capacity. Being very sensitive to water logging, heavy soils with poor drainage capacity is not preferred for wheat cultivation. Generally, black cotton soil with good drainage capacity and a neutral pH is preferred for cultivation. If wheat is grown as a dry crop heavy soil with a good drainage capacity is preferred. On the contrary, soil with moderate drainage capacity is preferred for wheat as irrigated crop. The soil used for wheat cultivation must be free from coarse sand, gravel, stones, have a uniform texture and should be deep. It must be soft enough to permit deeper root penetration.','One of the primary requirements of wheat cultivation is that the soil must be free of clods, stones, sand and gravel. Hence, the land must be ploughed at least 3 times during summer before cultivation. The residual crop debris can be burnt in the field itself. Following this the land must be harrowed again during the rainy season to prevent growth of wild plants and weeds. After this heavy harrowing, a light harrowing is done wherein the rots and stubble are removed. This step is conducted immediately before sowing. However, in case of irrigated crop, the land is not ploughed as many times. Irrigation is done before sowing so that there is adequate amount of moisture when sowing is done.','Before sowing, the seeds are treated with 5-gram Trichoderma spores or 5 Kg carbendazim for every 1 Kg seed. Wheat seeds are also given solar treatment so as to avoid diseases like wheat smut on the crop. There should be a space of 15- 20 cm maintained between the seeds. In case of late sowing the seeds must be soaked overnight in water. Shallow sowing must be done and it should be covered with a thin layer of farm yard manure.','Flood irrigation is the most common type of irrigation followed. Although irrigation is needed only once in every 10 days, it is done only once in every 15 days in case black soil is used for cultivation. On an average about 6-7 irrigation cycles are needed for wheat since they are ready for harvest within 120 days. In other words, irrigation is provided at the most crucial stages like crown root initiation, leaf growth development (tillering), Jointing Stage which is the most critical stage as it provides evidence that plants have initiated the reproductive phase, Flowering stage, Ripening stage and Maturity stage','Wheat is a highly-nutritional and widely-cultivated cereal grain. For over 7 centuries, wheat has been raised and harvested in many countries around the world. It’s one of the world’s most important crops and holds the title of the second most produced grain in the world, beaten only by corn. Over 750 million metric tons of wheat were produced in 2017/18 worldwide. It’s also consumed more than any other grain in the world except for rice and provides 20% of the global population’s daily protein intake. The reason that wheat is such an important dietary staple across so many regions is due to its ability to be produced in many different types of soils and climates.','It is better to use fertilizer on the basis of soil testing report. To get good yield of dwarf variety of wheat after the crop of maize, paddy, jowar, bajra in Kharif, use at the rate of 120:60:40 kg per hectare and in case of late sowing, 80: 40:30 nitrogen, phosphorous and potash respectively. In Bundelkhand region, use of nitrogen, phosphorous and potash at the rate of in120: 60:40 kg per hectare respectively and 30 kg sulphur per hectare has been found beneficial in normal condition. In the areas where DAP is being continuously used, use of 30 kg sulphur would be beneficial. If the field was left vacant in Kharif or pulses were grown, use 20 kg less nitrogen per hectare. Use 60 quintal farm yard manure for good yield. It helps in maintaining soil fertility.'),(5,'Rice','3','/IMG/crops/rice.jpg','In India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate. Rice cultivation in India extends from 8 to35ºN latitude and from sea level to as high as 3000 meters. Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water. The average temperature required throughout the life period of the crop ranges from 21 to 37º C. Maximum temp which the crop can tolerate 400C to 42 0C. ','The varieties grown during this season are mostly varieties of short duration ranging from 90 to 110 days. The main rice growing season in the country is the \'Kharif\'. It is known as winter rice as per the harvesting time. The sowing time of winter (kharif) rice is June-July and it is harvested in November-December.','Rice is a tropical plant that requires sufficient water to grow well. Therefore, the soil used in growing rice should have a good water holding capacity. Silt clay, silt clay loam and clay are some of the soil textures that are best for rice farming. Fertile riverine alluvial soil is best for rice cultivation. Although pH of rice soil become neutral, it should be 5 - 8.  Because, if soil is more acidic or more alkaline, it will need more time to become neutral. As a result, plant have to face unfavourable situation. For example, rice cultivation or yield is not satisfactory in acid soil.','The main systems followed in rice cultivation are ‘dry’, ‘semi-dry’ and ‘wet’. Basically, the dry and semi-dry systems of cultivation depend on rains and do not have supplementary irrigation facilities whereas, in wet cultivation system, the rice crop is grown with assured and abundant water supply either by rain or by irrigation. ','Dry and semi-dry system: for this system of rice crop the field should have good tilth that can be achieved by giving a couple of ploughings and harrowing, Field should be supplemented with farm yard manure (FMY)/compost DISTRIBUTED uniformly 2 weeks to 4 weeks before sowing or planting. The seeds should be shown either by broadcasting or drilling method and line sowing would help in weeding and intercultural operations. The row to row spacing in case of drill sowing method is 20cm to 25cm. Wet system: When following this system of cultivation method, the land should be ploughed thoroughly and puddled with 3cm to 5cm of standing water in the field. The ideal depth of puddling is found to be around 10cm in clay soils and clay-loamy soils. The land should be levelled after puddling to facilitate a uniform distribution of water and fertilizers. Paddy seeds should be sown after sprouting or the seedlings of rice should be transplanted in the main field. ','The stage at which the water stress causes severe yield reduction is also known as critical stage of water requirement.  It is also known as moisture sensitive period. Critical stages of water requirement in rice are Active tillering, Panicle initiation, Booting, Heading and Flowering. During these stages, the irrigation interval should not exceed the stipulated time so as to cause the depletion of moisture below the saturation level.','Rice, (Oryza sativa), edible starchy cereal grain and the grass plant (family Poaceae) by which it is produced. Roughly one-half of the world population, including virtually all of East and Southeast Asia, is wholly dependent upon rice as a staple food; 95 percent of the world’s rice crop is eaten by humans. Rice is cooked by boiling, or it can be ground into a flour. It is eaten alone and in a great variety of soups, side dishes, and main dishes in Asian, Middle Eastern, and many other cuisines. Other products in which rice is used are breakfast cereals, noodles, and such alcoholic beverages as Japanese sake.','As rice crop responds very well to manure and chemicals, it is essential for proper manures and fertilizers in paddy cultivation. Farm yard manure/Compost: 10 to 15 cartloads. Nitrogen: 100 to 150 Kg/ha. Phosphorous: 50 to 60 Kg P205/ha. Potash: 40 to 50 KO/ha. Zinc Sulphate: 25Kg/Ha. Green Manuring Crops: Sanai, Dhaincha and Moong/Urad.'),(6,'Maize','3','/IMG/crops/maize.jpg','Maize is the third most important cereal crop in India after rice and wheat. Maize is primarily a rainfed kharif crop which is sown just before monsoon starts. This crop usually grows well under temperatures varying from 22 degree C to 30 degree C, although it can tolerate temperature s high as 35-degree C. This crop is affected by frost, so it is grown where at least 5 frost-free months available in a year. It requires at least 50 to 90 cm of rainfall. It is not recommended to cultivate this crop in the areas where rainfall is more that 100mm.','In kharif season, crop is sown in month of May end to June corresponding with the onset of monsoon. Spring crops are sown during late February to end of march. Plantation of baby corn can be done all the year round, except December and January. Kharif and rabi season are best for sweet corn sowing','Maize or corn can be cultivated successfully in a variety of soils ranging from clay loam to sand loamy to back cotton soil. For a better yield of maize, one should consider soils with good organic matter content having high water holding capacity. Well-drained soil with a pH of 5.5 to 7 are preferred for maize farming. A soil test is recommended to find out the deficiency of any nutrient values in the soil, any deficiency can be covered by adding good organic matter or compost at the time of land preparation.','The selected field should be free of volunteer maize plants. Volunteer plants are basically unwanted plants that are grown from previous maize crop. These maize plants may be a different variety, so there is a chance that genetic contamination may occur. Plowing should be done to get fine tilth, it may take 6 or 7 plows. At least 13 to 14 tons of Farm Yard Manure per hectare (F.M.Y) should be spread across the field or composted coir pith and apply 10 Azospirillum packets in the field. Prepare furrows and ridges with 45 cm to 50 cm spacing to save the irrigated water. ','In maize, farming propagation is done by seeds. One should adopt a plant-to-plant spacing of 10cm and sow 2 seeds per hill. Should sow the seeds 1/3rd of the ridge from the bottom.','As soon as sowing is done, immediate irrigation is required in the field. Subsequently, give life irrigation on the third or fourth day and based on the soil type and season. (It may not be required in rainy season). Usually for maize crop, up to 25 to 30 days, a smaller number of irrigations is recommended, afterward, it is required to irrigate once in a week. During the early stage of this crop, water stagnation should be avoided and should have good drainage.','Corn, (Zea mays), also called Indian corn or maize, cereal plant of the grass family (Poaceae) and its edible grain. The domesticated crop originated in the Americas and is one of the most widely distributed of the world’s food crops. Corn is used as livestock feed, as human food, as biofuel, and as raw material in industry. In the United States the colourful variegated strains known as Indian corn are traditionally used in autumn harvest decorations.','For obtaining high yield, the maize crop should be heavily manured. Twenty five to thirty cartloads of farmyard manure or compost should be ploughed into the soil before the sowing. For hybrid and composite varieties of maize, 100-120 kg of nitrogen, along with 60 kg of P2O5 and 40 kg of K2O per hectare, is recommended. The precise level of application of phosphorus and potash should be modified in the background of soil analysis. One third of the nitrogen and total quantity of potash and phosphorus should be applied before sowing, while the remaining nitrogen should be applied as a side dressing at the Knee high stage and at selling in two equal doses. In freshly leveled fields and soils with very light texture, a soil application of 10-20 kg/ha of zinc sulphate before sowing has also given good results. To control soil infesting insects, 10-20 kg of 10% DDT or BHC per hectare may be mixed with the basic fertilizer application. Farmers planting local varieties may apply 40-60 kg of nitrogen to the soil per hectare.'),(7,'Bajra','3','/IMG/crops/bajra.jpg','Bajra grows well in dry and warm climatic conditions and its drought-tolerant crop which requires low annual rainfall ranging between 40cm to 60cm. The ideal temperature for bajra cultivation is between 20 degree C to 30-degree C. Moist weather is advantageous during its vegetative growth. In north India, bajra is grown as kharif crop and in some southern part is grown as summer crop providing irrigation.','Bajra can be grown on poor light sandy soils, black and red soils and on upland gravely soils. It is a kharif crop which is sown between May and September and harvested between October and Feb./March. It is sown either as a pure or mixed crop with cotton, jowar and ragi. It is a rainfed crop and is seldom irrigated.','Bajra can be grown in a wide range of soils. However, it thrives best in black cotton soils, sandy loam soils having good drainage. This crop does not prefer acidic and waterlogging soils. Avoid saturated soils for its cultivation. It grows successfully well in soils with low pH or high salinity. Bajra can be easily grown in regions where other cereal crops like wheat or maize would not survive. ','The crop needs very fine tilt because the seeds are too small. 2-3 harrowing and a ploughing is followed so that a fine tilth may be obtained to facilitate the sowing and proper distribution of seed at appropriate depth.','','Bajra is grown rainfed and crop being drought resistant hardly needs any irrigation, however it is observed that the yield may be significantly increased by irrigating the crop at critical growth stages like maximum tillering, flowering and grain filling stage. Therefore, light irrigations and efficient drainage is very essential for bajra production','Bajra popularly known as Pearl millet, cattail millet or bulrush belongs to the family Graminea. The crop is cultivated for grain as well as for fodder in the arid region of Africa and Asia and as a pasture in U.S.A. It is originated in India or Africa. It is grown all over India except Assam and part of northeast India.','At time of field preparation add well decomposed cow dung 20ton/acre.15 days after sowing, add Nitrogen 30kg/acre in form of Urea 70kg/acre. After each cutting, repeat this nitrogen dose. Apply Phosphorus 40kg/acre in form of SSP 240kg/acre in two equal splits, first dose in spring and second dose in monsoon.'),(8,'Jowar','3','/IMG/crops/jowar.jpg','Basically, jowar is a tropical crop. It thrives well at a temperature between 25 degree C and 32 degree C but below 16 degree C is not good for the crop. Jowar crop requires rainfall about 40 cm annually. Jowar is extreme drought tolerant crop and recommended for dry regions. Too much of moist and pro longed dry conditions are not suitable for jowar cultivation. ','The crop should be harvested at 60-75 days of sowing (50%, flowering stage) in case of single cut varieties and first cut at 40-45 days and subsequent cut at 30 days of intervals in case of multicut varieties.','Jowar crop adapts wide range of soils but grows well in sandy loam soils having good drainage. Soil pH range of 6 to 7.5 is ideal for its cultivation and better growth. The main field should be ploughed and levelled to fine for weeds free sowing.','One should avoid rocky field and 1 to 2 ploughings followed by 2 crosswise harrowing are required to prepare a good seed bed. As the jowar crop does not tolerate water lagging, the field should be prepared with well drainage. Deep summer ploughing with mould board plough soon after rabi crop is harvested and leaving the soil exposed to sun until onset of monsoon is a common practice. With the onset of monsoon, the land should be ploughed twice by country plough. But the soil for grain crop should be pulverised for a fine tilth by harrowing and cross planking. If desired, field should be levelled before sowing so that rainwater may be well distributed throughout the field','Sorghum crop is grown in almost all the seasons of the year. In Northern India conditions it is grown in kharif season but in Southern India the crop is grown during Rabi and summer seasons. Kharif crop should be sown soon after first break of monsoon rains i.e. nearly in last week of June. Therefore, the best sowing time is in last week of June to first week of July depending upon onset of monsoon. Whereas rabi jawar is sown in the month of October to November. A spacing of 40-45 cm between the rows and 15-20 cm between the plants is quite satisfactory. Required plant population may be obtained by using a seed rate of 8-12 kg/ha. The seeds are sown about 3-4 cm deep in the furrows.','If the crop is sown in monsoon time (July). It may require 1 to 3 irrigations depending upon rains. For summer crop, 6 to 7 irrigations may be carried out due to high temperature. Sorghum is a fairly drought resistant crop and it does very well in areas receiving 50 cm well distributed rainfall but it cannot withstand waterlogging at any stage of crop growth. The most critical growth stages for irrigation are knee-height stage, flowering and grain filling stages at which the crop should be ensured for proper moisture conditions so that the crop does not suffer from moisture stress. Contrary to this in kharif crop an efficient drainage must be provided as the crop cannot tolerate water accumulation for more than few hours, therefore, in low lying areas sowing of crop on 5-7cm high ridges or sowing in flat beds followed by light earthing is a remedy for stagnant water in the field.','Jowar is one of the major staple food grain crops in India. Out of the total area under jowar cultivation in India, 50% is cultivated in Maharashtra. Whereas out of the total production of Jowar in the nation, 52% is from Maharashtra. Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu.','Irrigated crop requires higher doses than rainfed ones no matter whether it is a local or high yielding variety. Considering all these points an optimum dose may be found out from the following details: an optimum dose of nitrogen for rainfed high yielding and local varieties of irrigated crop should be 60-80kg/ha while for irrigated high yielding varieties it should be between 120-150 kg/ha. In case of heavy soils one single application gives better results than split application but in case of light soils split application i.e. half basal and remaining half as top-dressing at knee-height stage or 30-35 days after sowing is preferred. Under low rainfall or in rainfed areas top-dressing of nitrogen is not required. On an average a dose of 40-60 kg P2O5/ha is found to be good. Placement at 4-6 cm depth has given better results. However, under normal conditions it is mostly basal placed. Potash at the rate of 40kg/ha applied at the time of field preparation gives good result.'),(9,'Ragi','3','/IMG/crops/ragi2.jpg','Ragi may be grown as a hot weather crop, from May to September, using long duration varieties and as a cold season crop, from November and December, using early types. Ragi is monocropped in India under irrigation or transplantation. Rainfed it is mostly intercropped with cereals, castor bean, niger, groundnut and pulses. The most common subsidiary crops grown with ragi are fieldbean (Lablab purpureus), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), cowpea (Vigna sinensis), and niger (Guizotia abysinnica). With groundnuts, ragi is the subsidiary crop. Liberal manure, mainly sheep and cattle, is applied. Green manures such as cowpeas, sunnhemp, artificial manures and oil cakes, have been used on both irrigated and unirrigated crops. Ragi is chopped and weeded at intervals of 14 days or so. The number and frequency of irrigations varies with seasonal conditions.','Ragi matures 3-5 months after sowing, depending on variety, season and soil properties. Rainfed crops are cut close to ground, stalks are allowed to wither for a day or two in field, and then bundled and stacked for about 2 months before threshing. ','Ragi crop can be grown on a wide range of soils from rich loam to poor shallow upland soils with good organic matter. However, porous/ light red loam/ sandy loam soils with good internal drainage are good for its cultivation. Black soils with good drainage can also be considered for this crop cultivation as it tolerates comewhat water stagnation. Ragi crop thrives best in soils with pH of 4.5 to 8. Heavy clay soils with poor water drainage should be avoided.','The land is prepared separately for irrigated and rainfed conditions. In areas with a rainfall of 60 to 75 cm, ragi is cultivated as a rainfed crop. So the field should be deeply ploughed for moisture conservation. But in irrigated crop, plough the field immediately at the arrival of monsoon until gets fine tilth.','A plant population of 4 to 5 lakhs per ha is optimum for getting higher yields and higher or lower population than the optimum will reduce the yield. There are various methods practiced for ragi cultivation. In rainfed ragi, ragi is grown as intercrop or mixed crop with non-cereal crops. In irrigated ragi, ragi is grown as sole crop. Methods are used for irrigated and rainfed ragi, direct sowing, line sowing and drilling in rows.','As finger millet is rainy season crop it does not required irrigation. But at stage of tillering and flowering, if rain stops for long period then irrigation is necessary for good plant growth along with good yield. Prepared furrows and ridges for irrigation purpose, it serves dual purpose of irrigation and drainage. This crop cannot withstand in waterlogged condition, therefor care should be taken for complete removal of excess water.','It is known as finger millet, African finger millet, red millet and ragi, are the oldest food and first cereal grain used for domestic purpose. Finger millet is originally native to the Ethiopian highlands and was introduced into India approximately 4000 years ago. They can be grown in dry weather; can withstand severe drought conditions and adaptable to higher elevations. These are short duration, ready to harvest as little in 65 day and can be easily grown throughout the year. It is highly grown crops among all small millets. It is rich source of protein and minerals in comparison to all other cereals and millets. It contains important amino acids. It has the highest amount of calcium (344 mg) and potassium (408 mg). It is beneficial for individuals with low haemoglobin levels as it is great source of iron.','Incorporate 13 tonnes Farm Yard Manure (FMY)/ha in the soil. Application of the fertilizers like NPK depends on the region and soil. Different states have different requirements for both irrigated and rained conditions. For example: Ragi cultivation in Tamil Nadu requires NPK of 30:30:30 Kg/ha at the time of seed sowing and where as Maharashtra  and Karnataka requires NPK of 50:50:50 Kg/ha at the time of seed sowing. For other regions based on the fertility of the soil, NPK should be applied.'),(10,'Arhar (Tur)','3','/IMG/crops/arhar.jpg','Toor dal (arhar) need moist and warm weather i.e. 3o-35c during germination and slightly lower temperature (20-25c) during active vegetative growth.

Pigeonpea can be grown between 14°N and 28°N latitude, with a temperature ranging from 26° to 30°C in the rainy season and 17° to 22°C in the post rainy season. The amount of daily global solar radiation varies from 400 to 430 cal cm day in the rainy season and 380-430 cal cm-2 day-1 in the postrainy season. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 600 to 1400 mm, of which 80%-90% is received in the rainy season. The length of growing season extends from 120 to 180 days. Pigeonpea is very sensitive to low radiation at pod development, therefore flowering during the monsoon and cloudy weather, leads to poor pod formation.','Toor dal being a deep-rooted crop responds well to a proper tilth. So land is prepared by at least one plowing during the dry season followed by 2 or 3 harrowings and disc plowing. Organic manure may be applied 2-4 weeks before sowing, Soil should be well levelled so that water stagnation does not take place, Contour broad-beds and furrows or a ridge-and-furrow system are useful in preventing water logging. Weeds should be properly removed, well tilled and crusting should be avoided by mechanical means. Light irrigation helps in seedling emergence.','The seed rate is 15kg/ha. Tall verities of arhar should be sown in rows at a distance of 50 cm while dwarf varieties like HPA-92 should be shown at 30-35cm row spacing with seed to seed spacing of 15-20 cm. The crop gives a much higher yield if, it is sown in the last week of may. One row of Mach can also be successfully grown in between two rows of Arhar. In ZoneI, paired row planting of arhar and sesamum gives a higher return. In case pf paired row planting, two rows of arhar should be sown at 30 cm spacing followed by two rows of sesamum sown at 20 cm spacing. The seed rate and fertilizer doses  to the sesamum crop should be reduced to half of the recommended for pure sesamum crop.','Red Gram requires 35-40 cm water, during its entire growth period. Optimum moisture is necessary during (a) budding (b) flowering and (c) pod formation stages. As red gram is a rainfed crop grown in assured rainfall areas, usually it does not require any irrigation. If there is water stress, protective irrigation may be given in alternate rows at these 3 stages.','Tur Dal is commonly known as the toor dal, tuvar dal or arhar dal. In Western countries they are known as pigeon pea, congo pea, gungo pea (in Jamaica), Pois congo (in Haiti), Gandul (in Puerto Rico).

Spring crop would require about 6 to 7 irrigations.','Soybean, (Glycine max), also called soja bean or soya bean, annual legume of the pea family (Fabaceae) and its edible seed. The soybean is economically the most important bean in the world, providing vegetable protein for millions of people and ingredients for hundreds of chemical products.','Apply 20 kg N and 80 kg P2O5 and 40 kg K2O and 40 kg of S as gypsum (220 kg/ha) /ha as basal dressing. Soil application of 25 kg ZnSO4/ha under irrigated condition. Foliar spray of NAA 40 mg/l and Salicylic acid 100 mg/l once at pre-flowering and another at 15 days thereafter. Foliar spray of DAP 20 g/l or urea 20 g/l once at flowering and another at 15 days thereafter.'),(19,'Sunflower','4','/IMG/crops/sunflower.jpg','The crop requires a cool climate during germination and seedling growth. Seedlings tolerate frosts moderately well until they reach the 4 to 6 leaf stage development. It requires warm weather from the seedling stage up to the flowering stage and warm and sunny days during flowering to maturity. High humidity accompanied by cloudy weather and rainfall at the time of flowering results in poor seed set. ','Sunflower is a photo-insensitive crop therefore, it takes about 80 to 90 days in kharif, 105 to 130 days in rubi and 100 to 110 days in the spring season. Sunflower can be done in any month of the year.','Sunflower can be grown on a wide range of soils and tolerates a moderate pH range and some salinity. It thrives best on deep loam soils with good drainage and irrigation facilities. The optimum range of soil pH for this crop is 6.5 to 8.5. It performs better than groundnut in heavy black cotton soils of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.','Sunflower is one crop in the case of which, the season of planting are not the limiting factors. Three to four ploughing and diskings are sufficient for preparing the land. Soil should be moist at least 10cm deep before sowing and this condition necessitates good soaking rains or irrigation before sowing. Seed rate is 8-10kg of well-filled seeds per hectare. For controlling seed-borne fungal diseases, seed treatment with either Brassical or Captan 3g per kg of seed is recommended. The pre-soaking of seed for 12-24 hours ensures a rapid and high percentage of germination, an early emergence and establishment of the crop. The seed is drilled at a depth of 5cm by adopting a spacing of 45cm between rows and 30cm between plants in the row.','The seed before sowing must be treated with Captan or Ceresan at the rate of 3g/kg of seed. Bold and certified seeds should be used. A seed rate of 8-10 kg/hectare is sufficient to ensure good crop stand, sunflower should be sown 60 cm apart in lines with a plant to plant spacing of 20 cm. The seed should be sown 3-4 cm depth for the better stand. Sowing can be done by corn planter in the furrows. After 10-12 days of germination, extra seedlings should be uprooted to provide a space of 20cm between plants in rows.','In sunflower farming, normally no irrigation is needed for kharif crop. However, one irrigation may be given in case of uneven distribution of rainfall. Rabi crop may be irrigated thrice after 40, 75 and 110 days of sowing. Sunflower crop is highly sensitive to water stress between flowering and grain filling stages. Therefore, one irrigation may be provided in case of moisture deficiency during this stage. Irrigation requirement of the crop during summer is relatively higher. Irrigation at the grain-filling stage should be light and given on calm and windless evening to avoid lodging. Among the various stages, bud initiation, flowering period and seed development stages are critical stages in terms of irrigation.','Sunflower, Helianthus annuus, is an herbaceous annual plant in the family Asteraceae, grown for its seeds. The plant has a thick, hairy, erect stem which gives rise to a large flower head. The plant has large, broad lower leaves which are oval and arranged alternately on the stem and smaller, narrower upper leaves which are attached individually to the stem. The flower head is a large disc reaching 10–30 cm (4–12 in) in diameter which is made up of 16–30 individual florets which are yellow-gold in color. The outer florets are sterile and produce the outer petals of the flower head, while the inner florets will mature into the seeds in the central disc. Sunflowers are annual plants, harvested after one growing season and can reach 1–3.5 m (3.3–11.5 ft) in height. Sunflower may also be referred to as girasole and originates from North America.','The crop performs best when both organic and inorganic fertilizers are applied to it. The fertilizer Nitrogen:Phosphrous:Potash (NPK) schedules recommended in the case of rainfed and irrigated crops are 20:30:20 and 40:60:40 kg (NPK) of per hectare, respectively.'),(20,'Safflower','4','/IMG/crops/safflower.jpg','The crop is grown during rabi primarily as a rainfed crop. At all stages of growth of the crop, excessive rainfall or humidity increases damage from fungal diseases. Water-logging due to poor drainage or prolonged rains can cause substantial fall in seed-yield.','Three to five irrigations should be given to safflower in medium to lighter type of soils for higher yields. Safflower should be irrigated twice i.e. at 35 and 55 days after sowing in medium to heavy soils for higher yields. If only one irrigation is available, it should be given at 55 days after sowing.','It is cultivated on all types of soil, including sandy soil, but it thrives best on water-retentive black soils and alluvial loams. The crop is fairly resistant to saline conditions','Land should be ploughed couple of times to bring the soil to fine tilth stage. Any weeds should be removed from previous crops. Any clods should be crushed and levelled in such a way that there won’t be any water logging.','In general, the pure crop is given one or two weedings, combined with hoeings on the 20th and the 45th day after sowing. When growth in strips, a row spacing of 45cm is adopted.','This crop is mostly grown in areas where less rainfall is expected and no availability of irrigation. However, one can expect higher yields with irrigation. If the soil is very likely to respond to irrigation. Watering and moisture in the soil is very important at the time of flowering and grain filling stages, hence one irrigation in a month should be provided after planting as this h elps in better growth of the safflower crop.','Safflower is a plant. The flower and oil from the seeds are used as medicine.Safflower seed oil is used for high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, to prevent scarring, and for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. In foods, safflower seed oil is used as a cooking oil. In manufacturing, safflower flower is used to color cosmetics and dye fabrics. Safflower seed oil is used as a paint solvent.','The application of 20-40kg of nitrogen (N) per hectare results in a substantial increase in yield. The mixed crop shares the preparatory tillage, manuring and cultivation given to the main crop. When the plants have developed the central flowering head, they are topped to promote branching, flowering and seed production.'),(21,'Linseed','4','/IMG/crops/linseed2.jpg','Its cultivation is confined to low elevations, but it cane be successfully grown up to 770 metres. Areas with the annual rainfall ranging from 45-75cm are best suited for its cultivation. The seed crop does well under moderate cold, but the fibre crop grows best in cool moist climates.','Linseed is purely a cool season rabi crop. Temperate and cool climate conditions are best suited for growth. The minimum temperature regime is 10oC while the maximum is 38 oC. Thus, the main season for sowing linseed is October to November depending upon the availability of soil moisture. Early sowing helps the crop to escape attack of powdery mildew, rust and linseed bud fly in different regions. The crop takes 120 to 140 days to mature depending on the cultivar. The oilseed crop needs about 25 to 30 oC during germination and vegetative phase and 15 to 20 oC during seed formation. An annual rainfall of 700 to 750 mm is optimum. Under dry climates irrigation is essential. A well-distributed rainfall of 450 to 500 mm can also suffice to grow good crop of linseed. The elevation of 400 to 500 mm from sea level is quite suitable. Drought and high temperature at early and seed filling stages are detrimental causing yield and quality reduction.','It does best on clay loams, deep clayey black soils. It does well on the deep clayey black soils of central and peninsular India and on the alluvium loams of the Indo-Gangetic plains except The sandy and badly drained heavy clays.','It is often grown on marginal and sub-marginal rainfed soils. Two to three ploughings are done with subsequent 2 to 3 harrowings. Seedbed should be free from weeds and other debris. Linseed requires firm fine seedbed free from compaction and plough plan. There should be fewer larger clumps. To conserve moisture, it is advisable to create soil mulch with the help of a hoe after each good shower.','The main season for sowing linseed is October to November. The crop is sown either broadcast or is drilled in lines 20 to 30cm apart. For broadcast sowing the seed-rate is kept at 40kg per ha. For line-sowing, the seed-rate varies from 20-30kg per ha, depending upon the seed size.','Yields can be doubled with 1 or 2 irrigations given at 35 and 75 DAS. On light soils, 3-4 irrigations may be needed. Branching, flowering and grain filling are critical stages for irrigation.','Flax (Linum usitatissimum), also known as common flax or linseed, is a member of the genus Linum in the family Linaceae. It is a food and fiber crop cultivated in cooler regions of the world. Textiles made from flax are known in Western countries as linen, and are traditionally used for bed sheets, underclothes, and table linen. Its oil is known as linseed oil. In addition to referring to the plant itself, the word \"flax\" may refer to the unspun fibers of the flax plant.','Under rainfed conditions, the fertilizer dose including 30kg of nitrogen (N) and 15 kg of phosphorus (P) per ha is given. Under irrigated conditions, the linseed crop requires 60kg of N and 30kg of P per ha. The deep placement of fertilizer at sowing in the case of the rainfed crop gives better results. Under irrigated conditions, nitrogen is applied in two splits-half the dose as basal and the other half at the first irrigation, 40-50 days after sowing. The rainfed crop generally requires no interculture. When the crop is irrigated, one weeding becomes essential.'),(22,'Niger Seed','4','/IMG/crops/niger.jpeg','Sown under rained situations in kharif and rabi as a sole crop or mixed crop with little millet, finger millet, pearl millet, groundnut or pulse crops in different States.

The seed contains 37- 47% oil, which is pale yellow with nutty taste and a pleasant odour. The oil is used for culinary purposes, anointing the body, manufacturing paints and soft soaps and for lighting and lubrication. The niger oil is good absorbent of fragrance of flowers due to which it is used as a base oil by perfume industry. Niger oil can be used for birth control and treatment of syphilis.  Niger seed cake is a valuable cattle feed particularly for milch cattle. Niger meal with 30% protein and 17% crude fibre in India could replace linseed cake in calf ration. It can also be used as a manure. Niger is also used as a green manure for increasing soil organic carbon.','The crop is mostly grown on marginal and sub-marginal land without manure or fertilizer application. However, application of recommended N through urea + seed treatment with PSB 10 g/kg seed enhances yield significantly.

In addition, it can be cultivated anywhere from land on sea level to an altitude of up to 3300 meters. Places with a cool, moist weather for most part of the year followed by a short, dry and warm spell is most suited for wheat cultivation. This type of weather condition permits appropriate maturing and ripening of grains. However, areas with heavy rainfall, moist and warm climate are not suited for commercial wheat farming. Similarly, drought-like conditions, extremely low or high temperatures during the flowering stage would affect the wheat crop. During high temperature, a lot of energy is lost owing to transpiration. Hence, there is very little residual energy left within the crop resulting in low yields. High humidity and low temperature are likely to induce rust attack on the crops.','Wheat is a Rabi crop that is grown in the winter season. Sowing of wheat takes place in October to December and harvesting is done during the months of February and May. The wheat crop needs cool winters and hot summers, which is why the fertile plains of the Indo-Gangetic region are the most conducive for growing it.','Wheat needs soil with a moderate amount of water holding capacity. Being very sensitive to water logging, heavy soils with poor drainage capacity is not preferred for wheat cultivation. Generally, black cotton soil with good drainage capacity and a neutral pH is preferred for cultivation. If wheat is grown as a dry crop heavy soil with a good drainage capacity is preferred. On the contrary, soil with moderate drainage capacity is preferred for wheat as irrigated crop. The soil used for wheat cultivation must be free from coarse sand, gravel, stones, have a uniform texture and should be deep. It must be soft enough to permit deeper root penetration.','One of the primary requirements of wheat cultivation is that the soil must be free of clods, stones, sand and gravel. Hence, the land must be ploughed at least 3 times during summer before cultivation. The residual crop debris can be burnt in the field itself. Following this the land must be harrowed again during the rainy season to prevent growth of wild plants and weeds. After this heavy harrowing, a light harrowing is done wherein the rots and stubble are removed. This step is conducted immediately before sowing. However, in case of irrigated crop, the land is not ploughed as many times. Irrigation is done before sowing so that there is adequate amount of moisture when sowing is done.','Before sowing, the seeds are treated with 5-gram Trichoderma spores or 5 Kg carbendazim for every 1 Kg seed. Wheat seeds are also given solar treatment so as to avoid diseases like wheat smut on the crop. There should be a space of 15- 20 cm maintained between the seeds. In case of late sowing the seeds must be soaked overnight in water. Shallow sowing must be done and it should be covered with a thin layer of farm yard manure.','Flood irrigation is the most common type of irrigation followed. Although irrigation is needed only once in every 10 days, it is done only once in every 15 days in case black soil is used for cultivation. On an average about 6-7 irrigation cycles are needed for wheat since they are ready for harvest within 120 days. In other words, irrigation is provided at the most crucial stages like crown root initiation, leaf growth development (tillering), Jointing Stage which is the most critical stage as it provides evidence that plants have initiated the reproductive phase, Flowering stage, Ripening stage and Maturity stage','Wheat is a highly-nutritional and widely-cultivated cereal grain. For over 7 centuries, wheat has been raised and harvested in many countries around the world. It’s one of the world’s most important crops and holds the title of the second most produced grain in the world, beaten only by corn. Over 750 million metric tons of wheat were produced in 2017/18 worldwide. It’s also consumed more than any other grain in the world except for rice and provides 20% of the global population’s daily protein intake. The reason that wheat is such an important dietary staple across so many regions is due to its ability to be produced in many different types of soils and climates.','It is better to use fertilizer on the basis of soil testing report. To get good yield of dwarf variety of wheat after the crop of maize, paddy, jowar, bajra in Kharif, use at the rate of 120:60:40 kg per hectare and in case of late sowing, 80: 40:30 nitrogen, phosphorous and potash respectively. In Bundelkhand region, use of nitrogen, phosphorous and potash at the rate of in120: 60:40 kg per hectare respectively and 30 kg sulphur per hectare has been found beneficial in normal condition. In the areas where DAP is being continuously used, use of 30 kg sulphur would be beneficial. If the field was left vacant in Kharif or pulses were grown, use 20 kg less nitrogen per hectare. Use 60 quintal farm yard manure for good yield. It helps in maintaining soil fertility.'),(24,'Cotton','1','/IMG/crops/cotton2.jpg','Cotton is a tropical and subtropical crop. For the successful germination of its seeds, a minimum temperature of 15o C is required. The optimum temperature range for vegetative growth is 21 o - 27 o C. It can tolerate temperatures as high as 43 oC, but does not do well if the temperature falls below 21 oC. During the period of fruiting, warm days and cool nights with large diurnal variations are conducive to good boll and fibre development.','Cotton is a Kharif crop which requires 6 to 8 months to mature. Its time of sowing and harvesting differs in different parts of the country depending upon the climatic conditions. It is sown in April-May and is harvested in December-January that is before the winter frost can damage the crop.','In cotton selection on of soil is very important. Cotton is grown on a variety of soils. Soil should be black medium to deep (90cm) having good drainage availability. Cotton does not tolerate water-logging condition. It is grown mainly as a dry crop in the black cotton and medium black soil. Irrigated cotton is taken in the alluvial soils.','Cotton is sown on ridges and furrows. For irrigated cotton the land is given a deep ploughing followed by two harrowings. Ridges and furrows having different spacing for irrigated and rainfed cotton. For irrigated cotton shallow ridges on 90cm spacing should be prepared which helps in irrigation. According to slope of land, length of ridges should be 6-9m.','Seed treatment of fungicides should be given 3 gram per kg of cotton seed. Also seed treatment with biofertilizers viz. Azobacter, Azospirillum, and Phosphorous Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) 25 gram per kg of seeds. For seed treatment a paste of fungicides/biofertilizer should be prepared enough thick, which cover the seeds and these seeds dried in shade. After completely dried seeds should be used for sowing. Before sowing soil should be irrigated and after wapsa condition sowing should be done. Small shallow holes should be prepared on middle of the ridge upto 2-3 inch deep and applied recommended fertilizers and 1.0-1.5 gram of thimet and cover it with the soil. On each hill 3-4 cotton seeds should be dibble and cover completely with the soil and apply irrigation immediately.','In case of cotton germination, square initiation, flowering and boll formation and boll development are the critical stages for irrigation. The irrigated cotton crop is mostly sown after a preliminary irrigation and second the light watering is given in three or four days after germination. Subsequent watering depends upon the nature of the soil and the weather conditions. Flowering and boll formation are the critical stages from the point of view of irrigation. The summer sown crop gets frequent irrigations at intervals of 8-12 days. From sowing to square initiation period over irrigation should be avoided to stop the excessive vegetative growth. Skip row method should be followed if there is less availability of water. For first interval of irrigation water should be applied in first, third, fifth row and second interval water should be applied in second, fourth and sixth row.','Cotton, one of the world’s leading agricultural crops, is plentiful and economically produced, making cotton products relatively inexpensive. The fibres can be made into a wide variety of fabrics ranging from lightweight voiles and laces to heavy sailcloths and thick-piled velveteens, suitable for a great variety of wearing apparel, home furnishings, and industrial uses. Cotton fabrics can be extremely durable and resistant to abrasion. Cotton accepts many dyes, is usually washable, and can be ironed at relatively high temperatures. It is comfortable to wear because it absorbs and releases moisture quickly. When warmth is desired, it can be napped, a process giving the fabric a downy surface. Various finishing processes have been developed to make cotton resistant to stains, water, and mildew; to increase resistance to wrinkling, thus reducing or eliminating the need for ironing; and to reduce shrinkage in laundering to not more than 1 percent. ','As a first rule of thumb, cotton plant consumes Nitrogen (N) at a double quantity compared to Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K). Consequently, a N-P-K 20-10-10 fertilizer is more suitable, if a soil analysis is impossible. A common fertilization schedule applied by many cotton growers is adding 440 lbs. (200 kg) of N-P-K 20-10-10 per hectare during sowing (through the sowing machine), and 440 lbs. (200 kg) of N-P-K 20-10-10 per hectare during flowering (early summer). Keep in mind that 1 hectare = 10.000 square meters = 2,47 acres. Another common fertilization scheme is adding 550 lbs. (250 kg) of ammonium nitrate, 400 lbs. (181 kg) of N-P-K 0-46-0 and 400 lbs. (181 kg) of N-P-K 0-0-50 per hectare throughout the year. These quantities are normally spread in 8 equal applications, with the first being after sowing and the last around 6 weeks after flowering.'),(25,'Jute and Mesta','1','/IMG/crops/mesta.jpg','It requires temperature  25 degree C – 30 degree C.

Rice cultivation in India extends from 8 to35ºN latitude and from sea level to as high as 3000 meters. Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water. The average temperature required throughout the life period of the crop ranges from 21 to 37º C. Maximum temp which the crop can tolerate 400C to 42 0C. ','The varieties grown during this season are mostly varieties of short duration ranging from 90 to 110 days. The main rice growing season in the country is the \'Kharif\'. It is known as winter rice as per the harvesting time. The sowing time of winter (kharif) rice is June-July and it is harvested in November-December.','Rice is a tropical plant that requires sufficient water to grow well. Therefore, the soil used in growing rice should have a good water holding capacity. Silt clay, silt clay loam and clay are some of the soil textures that are best for rice farming. Fertile riverine alluvial soil is best for rice cultivation. Although pH of rice soil become neutral, it should be 5 - 8.  Because, if soil is more acidic or more alkaline, it will need more time to become neutral. As a result, plant have to face unfavourable situation. For example, rice cultivation or yield is not satisfactory in acid soil.','The main systems followed in rice cultivation are ‘dry’, ‘semi-dry’ and ‘wet’. Basically, the dry and semi-dry systems of cultivation depend on rains and do not have supplementary irrigation facilities whereas, in wet cultivation system, the rice crop is grown with assured and abundant water supply either by rain or by irrigation. ','Dry and semi-dry system: for this system of rice crop the field should have good tilth that can be achieved by giving a couple of ploughings and harrowing, Field should be supplemented with farm yard manure (FMY)/compost DISTRIBUTED uniformly 2 weeks to 4 weeks before sowing or planting. The seeds should be shown either by broadcasting or drilling method and line sowing would help in weeding and intercultural operations. The row to row spacing in case of drill sowing method is 20cm to 25cm. Wet system: When following this system of cultivation method, the land should be ploughed thoroughly and puddled with 3cm to 5cm of standing water in the field. The ideal depth of puddling is found to be around 10cm in clay soils and clay-loamy soils. The land should be levelled after puddling to facilitate a uniform distribution of water and fertilizers. Paddy seeds should be sown after sprouting or the seedlings of rice should be transplanted in the main field. ','The stage at which the water stress causes severe yield reduction is also known as critical stage of water requirement.  It is also known as moisture sensitive period. Critical stages of water requirement in rice are Active tillering, Panicle initiation, Booting, Heading and Flowering. During these stages, the irrigation interval should not exceed the stipulated time so as to cause the depletion of moisture below the saturation level.','Rice, (Oryza sativa), edible starchy cereal grain and the grass plant (family Poaceae) by which it is produced. Roughly one-half of the world population, including virtually all of East and Southeast Asia, is wholly dependent upon rice as a staple food; 95 percent of the world’s rice crop is eaten by humans. Rice is cooked by boiling, or it can be ground into a flour. It is eaten alone and in a great variety of soups, side dishes, and main dishes in Asian, Middle Eastern, and many other cuisines. Other products in which rice is used are breakfast cereals, noodles, and such alcoholic beverages as Japanese sake.','As rice crop responds very well to manure and chemicals, it is essential for proper manures and fertilizers in paddy cultivation.

Maize is primarily a rainfed kharif crop which is sown just before monsoon starts. This crop usually grows well under temperatures varying from 22 degree C to 30 degree C, although it can tolerate temperature s high as 35-degree C. This crop is affected by frost, so it is grown where at least 5 frost-free months available in a year. It requires at least 50 to 90 cm of rainfall. It is not recommended to cultivate this crop in the areas where rainfall is more that 100mm.','In kharif season, crop is sown in month of May end to June corresponding with the onset of monsoon. Spring crops are sown during late February to end of march. Plantation of baby corn can be done all the year round, except December and January. Kharif and rabi season are best for sweet corn sowing','Maize or corn can be cultivated successfully in a variety of soils ranging from clay loam to sand loamy to back cotton soil. For a better yield of maize, one should consider soils with good organic matter content having high water holding capacity. Well-drained soil with a pH of 5.5 to 7 are preferred for maize farming. A soil test is recommended to find out the deficiency of any nutrient values in the soil, any deficiency can be covered by adding good organic matter or compost at the time of land preparation.','The selected field should be free of volunteer maize plants. Volunteer plants are basically unwanted plants that are grown from previous maize crop. These maize plants may be a different variety, so there is a chance that genetic contamination may occur. Plowing should be done to get fine tilth, it may take 6 or 7 plows. At least 13 to 14 tons of Farm Yard Manure per hectare (F.M.Y) should be spread across the field or composted coir pith and apply 10 Azospirillum packets in the field. Prepare furrows and ridges with 45 cm to 50 cm spacing to save the irrigated water. ','In maize, farming propagation is done by seeds. One should adopt a plant-to-plant spacing of 10cm and sow 2 seeds per hill. Should sow the seeds 1/3rd of the ridge from the bottom.','As soon as sowing is done, immediate irrigation is required in the field. Subsequently, give life irrigation on the third or fourth day and based on the soil type and season. (It may not be required in rainy season). Usually for maize crop, up to 25 to 30 days, a smaller number of irrigations is recommended, afterward, it is required to irrigate once in a week. During the early stage of this crop, water stagnation should be avoided and should have good drainage.','Corn, (Zea mays), also called Indian corn or maize, cereal plant of the grass family (Poaceae) and its edible grain. The domesticated crop originated in the Americas and is one of the most widely distributed of the world’s food crops. Corn is used as livestock feed, as human food, as biofuel, and as raw material in industry. In the United States the colourful variegated strains known as Indian corn are traditionally used in autumn harvest decorations.','For obtaining high yield, the maize crop should be heavily manured. Twenty five to thirty cartloads of farmyard manure or compost should be ploughed into the soil before the sowing. For hybrid and composite varieties of maize, 100-120 kg of nitrogen, along with 60 kg of P2O5 and 40 kg of K2O per hectare, is recommended. The precise level of application of phosphorus and potash should be modified in the background of soil analysis. One third of the nitrogen and total quantity of potash and phosphorus should be applied before sowing, while the remaining nitrogen should be applied as a side dressing at the Knee high stage and at selling in two equal doses. In freshly leveled fields and soils with very light texture, a soil application of 10-20 kg/ha of zinc sulphate before sowing has also given good results. To control soil infesting insects, 10-20 kg of 10% DDT or BHC per hectare may be mixed with the basic fertilizer application. Farmers planting local varieties may apply 40-60 kg of nitrogen to the soil per hectare.');
