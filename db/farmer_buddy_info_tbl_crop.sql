In addition, it can be cultivated anywhere from land on sea level to an altitude of up to 3300 meters. Places with a cool, moist weather for most part of the year followed by a short, dry and warm spell is most suited for wheat cultivation. This type of weather condition permits appropriate maturing and ripening of grains. However, areas with heavy rainfall, moist and warm climate are not suited for commercial wheat farming. Similarly, drought-like conditions, extremely low or high temperatures during the flowering stage would affect the wheat crop. During high temperature, a lot of energy is lost owing to transpiration. Hence, there is very little residual energy left within the crop resulting in low yields. High humidity and low temperature are likely to induce rust attack on the crops.','Wheat is a Rabi crop that is grown in the winter season. Sowing of wheat takes place in October to December and harvesting is done during the months of February and May. The wheat crop needs cool winters and hot summers, which is why the fertile plains of the Indo-Gangetic region are the most conducive for growing it.','Wheat needs soil with a moderate amount of water holding capacity. Being very sensitive to water logging, heavy soils with poor drainage capacity is not preferred for wheat cultivation. Generally, black cotton soil with good drainage capacity and a neutral pH is preferred for cultivation. If wheat is grown as a dry crop heavy soil with a good drainage capacity is preferred. On the contrary, soil with moderate drainage capacity is preferred for wheat as irrigated crop. The soil used for wheat cultivation must be free from coarse sand, gravel, stones, have a uniform texture and should be deep. It must be soft enough to permit deeper root penetration.','One of the primary requirements of wheat cultivation is that the soil must be free of clods, stones, sand and gravel. Hence, the land must be ploughed at least 3 times during summer before cultivation. The residual crop debris can be burnt in the field itself. Following this the land must be harrowed again during the rainy season to prevent growth of wild plants and weeds. After this heavy harrowing, a light harrowing is done wherein the rots and stubble are removed. This step is conducted immediately before sowing.','Before sowing, the seeds are treated with 5-gram Trichoderma spores or 5 Kg carbendazim for every 1 Kg seed. Wheat seeds are also given solar treatment so as to avoid diseases like wheat smut on the crop. There should be a space of 15- 20 cm maintained between the seeds. In case of late sowing the seeds must be soaked overnight in water. Shallow sowing must be done and it should be covered with a thin layer of farm yard manure.','Flood irrigation is the most common type of irrigation followed. Although irrigation is needed only once in every 10 days, it is done only once in every 15 days in case black soil is used for cultivation. On an average about 6-7 irrigation cycles are needed for wheat since they are ready for harvest within 120 days.',NULL),(2,'Cotton','2','/IMG/crops/cotton2.jpg','Cotton is a tropical and subtropical crop. For the successful germination of its seeds, a minimum temperature of 15o C is required. The optimum temperature range for vegetative growth is 21 o - 27 o C. It can tolerate temperatures as high as 43 oC, but does not do well if the temperature falls below 21 oC. During the period of fruiting, warm days and cool nights with large diurnal variations are conducive to good boll and fibre development.','Cotton is a Kharif crop which requires 6 to 8 months to mature. Its time of sowing and harvesting differs in different parts of the country depending upon the climatic conditions. It is sown in April-May and is harvested in December-January that is before the winter frost can damage the crop.','In cotton selection on of soil is very important. Cotton is grown on a variety of soils. Soil should be black medium to deep (90cm) having good drainage availability. Cotton does not tolerate water-logging condition. It is grown mainly as a dry crop in the black cotton and medium black soil. Irrigated cotton is taken in the alluvial soils.','Cotton is sown on ridges and furrows. For irrigated cotton the land is given a deep ploughing followed by two harrowings. Ridges and furrows having different spacing for irrigated and rainfed cotton. For irrigated cotton shallow ridges on 90cm spacing should be prepared which helps in irrigation. According to slope of land, length of ridges should be 6-9m.','Seed treatment of fungicides should be given 3 gram per kg of cotton seed. Also seed treatment with biofertilizers viz. Azobacter, Azospirillum, and Phosphorous Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) 25 gram per kg of seeds. For seed treatment a paste of fungicides/biofertilizer should be prepared enough thick, which cover the seeds and these seeds dried in shade. After completely dried seeds should be used for sowing. Before sowing soil should be irrigated and after wapsa condition sowing should be done. Small shallow holes should be prepared on middle of the ridge upto 2-3 inch deep and applied recommended fertilizers and 1.0-1.5 gram of thimet and cover it with the soil. On each hill 3-4 cotton seeds should be dibble and cover completely with the soil and apply irrigation immediately.','In case of cotton germination, square initiation, flowering and boll formation and boll development are the critical stages for irrigation. The irrigated cotton crop is mostly sown after a preliminary irrigation and second the light watering is given in three or four days after germination. Subsequent watering depends upon the nature of the soil and the weather conditions. Flowering and boll formation are the critical stages from the point of view of irrigation. The summer sown crop gets frequent irrigations at intervals of 8-12 days. From sowing to square initiation period over irrigation should be avoided to stop the excessive vegetative growth. Skip row method should be followed if there is less availability of water. For first interval of irrigation water should be applied in first, third, fifth row and second interval water should be applied in second, fourth and sixth row.',NULL),(3,'Jute and Mesta','2','/IMG/crops/mesta.jpg','It requires temperature  25 degree C – 30 degree C.

In other words, irrigation is provided at the most crucial stages like crown root initiation, leaf growth development (tillering), Jointing Stage which is the most critical stage as it provides evidence that plants have initiated the reproductive phase, Flowering stage, Ripening stage and Maturity stage',NULL),(5,'Rice','3','/IMG/crops/rice.jpg','In India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate. Rice cultivation in India extends from 8 to35ºN latitude and from sea level to as high as 3000 meters. Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water. The average temperature required throughout the life period of the crop ranges from 21 to 37º C. Maximum temp which the crop can tolerate 400C to 42 0C. ','The varieties grown during this season are mostly varieties of short duration ranging from 90 to 110 days. The main rice growing season in the country is the \'Kharif\'. It is known as winter rice as per the harvesting time. The sowing time of winter (kharif) rice is June-July and it is harvested in November-December.','Rice is a tropical plant that requires sufficient water to grow well. Therefore, the soil used in growing rice should have a good water holding capacity. Silt clay, silt clay loam and clay are some of the soil textures that are best for rice farming. Fertile riverine alluvial soil is best for rice cultivation. Although pH of rice soil become neutral, it should be 5 - 8.  Because, if soil is more acidic or more alkaline, it will need more time to become neutral. As a result, plant have to face unfavourable situation. For example, rice cultivation or yield is not satisfactory in acid soil.','The main systems followed in rice cultivation are ‘dry’, ‘semi-dry’ and ‘wet’. Basically, the dry and semi-dry systems of cultivation depend on rains and do not have supplementary irrigation facilities whereas, in wet cultivation system, the rice crop is grown with assured and abundant water supply either by rain or by irrigation. ','Dry and semi-dry system: for this system of rice crop the field should have good tilth that can be achieved by giving a couple of ploughings and harrowing, Field should be supplemented with farm yard manure (FMY)/compost DISTRIBUTED uniformly 2 weeks to 4 weeks before sowing or planting. The seeds should be shown either by broadcasting or drilling method and line sowing would help in weeding and intercultural operations. The row to row spacing in case of drill sowing method is 20cm to 25cm. Wet system: When following this system of cultivation method, the land should be ploughed thoroughly and puddled with 3cm to 5cm of standing water in the field. The ideal depth of puddling is found to be around 10cm in clay soils and clay-loamy soils. The land should be levelled after puddling to facilitate a uniform distribution of water and fertilizers. Paddy seeds should be sown after sprouting or the seedlings of rice should be transplanted in the main field. ','The stage at which the water stress causes severe yield reduction is also known as critical stage of water requirement.  It is also known as moisture sensitive period. Critical stages of water requirement in rice are Active tillering, Panicle initiation, Booting, Heading and Flowering. During these stages, the irrigation interval should not exceed the stipulated time so as to cause the depletion of moisture below the saturation level.',NULL),(6,'Maize','3','/IMG/crops/maize.jpg','Maize is the third most important cereal crop in India after rice and wheat. Maize is primarily a rainfed kharif crop which is sown just before monsoon starts. This crop usually grows well under temperatures varying from 22 degree C to 30 degree C, although it can tolerate temperature s high as 35-degree C. This crop is affected by frost, so it is grown where at least 5 frost-free months available in a year. It requires at least 50 to 90 cm of rainfall. It is not recommended to cultivate this crop in the areas where rainfall is more that 100mm.','In kharif season, crop is sown in month of May end to June corresponding with the onset of monsoon. Spring crops are sown during late February to end of march. Plantation of baby corn can be done all the year round, except December and January. Kharif and rabi season are best for sweet corn sowing','Maize or corn can be cultivated successfully in a variety of soils ranging from clay loam to sand loamy to back cotton soil. For a better yield of maize, one should consider soils with good organic matter content having high water holding capacity. Well-drained soil with a pH of 5.5 to 7 are preferred for maize farming. A soil test is recommended to find out the deficiency of any nutrient values in the soil, any deficiency can be covered by adding good organic matter or compost at the time of land preparation.','The selected field should be free of volunteer maize plants. Volunteer plants are basically unwanted plants that are grown from previous maize crop. These maize plants may be a different variety, so there is a chance that genetic contamination may occur. Plowing should be done to get fine tilth, it may take 6 or 7 plows. At least 13 to 14 tons of Farm Yard Manure per hectare (F.M.Y) should be spread across the field or composted coir pith and apply 10 Azospirillum packets in the field. Prepare furrows and ridges with 45 cm to 50 cm spacing to save the irrigated water. ','In maize, farming propagation is done by seeds. One should adopt a plant-to-plant spacing of 10cm and sow 2 seeds per hill. Should sow the seeds 1/3rd of the ridge from the bottom.','As soon as sowing is done, immediate irrigation is required in the field. Subsequently, give life irrigation on the third or fourth day and based on the soil type and season. (It may not be required in rainy season). Usually for maize crop, up to 25 to 30 days, a smaller number of irrigations is recommended, afterward, it is required to irrigate once in a week. During the early stage of this crop, water stagnation should be avoided and should have good drainage.',NULL),(7,'Bajra','3','/IMG/crops/bajra.jpg','Bajra grows well in dry and warm climatic conditions and its drought-tolerant crop which requires low annual rainfall ranging between 40cm to 60cm. The ideal temperature for bajra cultivation is between 20 degree C to 30-degree C. Moist weather is advantageous during its vegetative growth. In north India, bajra is grown as kharif crop and in some southern part is grown as summer crop providing irrigation.','Bajra can be grown on poor light sandy soils, black and red soils and on upland gravely soils. It is a kharif crop which is sown between May and September and harvested between October and Feb./March. It is sown either as a pure or mixed crop with cotton, jowar and ragi. It is a rainfed crop and is seldom irrigated.','Bajra can be grown in a wide range of soils. However, it thrives best in black cotton soils, sandy loam soils having good drainage. This crop does not prefer acidic and waterlogging soils. Avoid saturated soils for its cultivation. It grows successfully well in soils with low pH or high salinity. Bajra can be easily grown in regions where other cereal crops like wheat or maize would not survive. ','The crop needs very fine tilt because the seeds are too small. 2-3 harrowing and a ploughing is followed so that a fine tilth may be obtained to facilitate the sowing and proper distribution of seed at appropriate depth.','','Bajra is grown rainfed and crop being drought resistant hardly needs any irrigation, however it is observed that the yield may be significantly increased by irrigating the crop at critical growth stages like maximum tillering, flowering and grain filling stage. Therefore, light irrigations and efficient drainage is very essential for bajra production',NULL),(8,'Jowar','3','/IMG/crops/jowar.jpg','Basically, jowar is a tropical crop. It thrives well at a temperature between 25 degree C and 32 degree C but below 16 degree C is not good for the crop. Jowar crop requires rainfall about 40 cm annually. Jowar is extreme drought tolerant crop and recommended for dry regions. Too much of moist and pro longed dry conditions are not suitable for jowar cultivation. ','The crop should be harvested at 60-75 days of sowing (50%, flowering stage) in case of single cut varieties and first cut at 40-45 days and subsequent cut at 30 days of intervals in case of multicut varieties.','Jowar crop adapts wide range of soils but grows well in sandy loam soils having good drainage. Soil pH range of 6 to 7.5 is ideal for its cultivation and better growth. The main field should be ploughed and levelled to fine for weeds free sowing.','One should avoid rocky field and 1 to 2 ploughings followed by 2 crosswise harrowing are required to prepare a good seed bed. As the jowar crop does not tolerate water lagging, the field should be prepared with well drainage. Deep summer ploughing with mould board plough soon after rabi crop is harvested and leaving the soil exposed to sun until onset of monsoon is a common practice. With the onset of monsoon, the land should be ploughed twice by country plough. But the soil for grain crop should be pulverised for a fine tilth by harrowing and cross planking. If desired, field should be levelled before sowing so that rainwater may be well distributed throughout the field','Sorghum crop is grown in almost all the seasons of the year. In Northern India conditions it is grown in kharif season but in Southern India the crop is grown during Rabi and summer seasons. Kharif crop should be sown soon after first break of monsoon rains i.e. nearly in last week of June. Therefore, the best sowing time is in last week of June to first week of July depending upon onset of monsoon. Whereas rabi jawar is sown in the month of October to November. A spacing of 40-45 cm between the rows and 15-20 cm between the plants is quite satisfactory. Required plant population may be obtained by using a seed rate of 8-12 kg/ha. The seeds are sown about 3-4 cm deep in the furrows.','If the crop is sown in monsoon time (July). It may require 1 to 3 irrigations depending upon rains. For summer crop, 6 to 7 irrigations may be carried out due to high temperature. Sorghum is a fairly drought resistant crop and it does very well in areas receiving 50 cm well distributed rainfall but it cannot withstand waterlogging at any stage of crop growth. The most critical growth stages for irrigation are knee-height stage, flowering and grain filling stages at which the crop should be ensured for proper moisture conditions so that the crop does not suffer from moisture stress. Contrary to this in kharif crop an efficient drainage must be provided as the crop cannot tolerate water accumulation for more than few hours, therefore, in low lying areas sowing of crop on 5-7cm high ridges or sowing in flat beds followed by light earthing is a remedy for stagnant water in the field.',NULL),(9,'Ragi','3','/IMG/crops/ragi2.jpg','Ragi may be grown as a hot weather crop, from May to September, using long duration varieties and as a cold season crop, from November and December, using early types. Ragi is monocropped in India under irrigation or transplantation. Rainfed it is mostly intercropped with cereals, castor bean, niger, groundnut and pulses. The most common subsidiary crops grown with ragi are fieldbean (Lablab purpureus), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), cowpea (Vigna sinensis), and niger (Guizotia abysinnica). With groundnuts, ragi is the subsidiary crop. Liberal manure, mainly sheep and cattle, is applied. Green manures such as cowpeas, sunnhemp, artificial manures and oil cakes, have been used on both irrigated and unirrigated crops. Ragi is chopped and weeded at intervals of 14 days or so. The number and frequency of irrigations varies with seasonal conditions.','Ragi matures 3-5 months after sowing, depending on variety, season and soil properties. Rainfed crops are cut close to ground, stalks are allowed to wither for a day or two in field, and then bundled and stacked for about 2 months before threshing. ','Ragi crop can be grown on a wide range of soils from rich loam to poor shallow upland soils with good organic matter. However, porous/ light red loam/ sandy loam soils with good internal drainage are good for its cultivation. Black soils with good drainage can also be considered for this crop cultivation as it tolerates comewhat water stagnation. Ragi crop thrives best in soils with pH of 4.5 to 8. Heavy clay soils with poor water drainage should be avoided.','The land is prepared separately for irrigated and rainfed conditions. In areas with a rainfall of 60 to 75 cm, ragi is cultivated as a rainfed crop. So the field should be deeply ploughed for moisture conservation. But in irrigated crop, plough the field immediately at the arrival of monsoon until gets fine tilth.','A plant population of 4 to 5 lakhs per ha is optimum for getting higher yields and higher or lower population than the optimum will reduce the yield. There are various methods practiced for ragi cultivation. In rainfed ragi, ragi is grown as intercrop or mixed crop with non-cereal crops. In irrigated ragi, ragi is grown as sole crop. Methods are used for irrigated and rainfed ragi, direct sowing, line sowing and drilling in rows.',NULL,NULL),(10,'Arhar (Tur)','3','/IMG/crops/arhar.jpg','Toor dal (arhar) need moist and warm weather i.e. 3o-35c during germination and slightly lower temperature (20-25c) during active vegetative growth. During flowering and pod setting it requires 15-18c temperature and at maturity, it needs a higher temperature of around 35-40c. waterlogging, heavy rains, frost are very harmful to the crop. Hailstorm or rain at maturity damages the entire crop. It has a good drought tolerant capacity because of its deep tap root system.','Rains during flowering results in poor pollination. Arhar crop grown successfully in summer, rainy and winter season, April-Summer, June-Kharif or rainy, September-rabi or winter season.','Pigeonpea is predominantly a crop of tropical areas mainly cultivated in semi-arid regions of India. Pigeonpea can be grown between 14°N and 28°N latitude, with a temperature ranging from 26° to 30°C in the rainy season and 17° to 22°C in the post rainy season. The amount of daily global solar radiation varies from 400 to 430 cal cm day in the rainy season and 380-430 cal cm-2 day-1 in the postrainy season. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 600 to 1400 mm, of which 80%-90% is received in the rainy season. The length of growing season extends from 120 to 180 days. Pigeonpea is very sensitive to low radiation at pod development, therefore flowering during the monsoon and cloudy weather, leads to poor pod formation.','Toor dal being a deep-rooted crop responds well to a proper tilth. So land is prepared by at least one plowing during the dry season followed by 2 or 3 harrowings and disc plowing. Organic manure may be applied 2-4 weeks before sowing, Soil should be well levelled so that water stagnation does not take place, Contour broad-beds and furrows or a ridge-and-furrow system are useful in preventing water logging. Weeds should be properly removed, well tilled and crusting should be avoided by mechanical means. Light irrigation helps in seedling emergence.','The seed rate is 15kg/ha. Tall verities of arhar should be sown in rows at a distance of 50 cm while dwarf varieties like HPA-92 should be shown at 30-35cm row spacing with seed to seed spacing of 15-20 cm. The crop gives a much higher yield if, it is sown in the last week of may. One row of Mach can also be successfully grown in between two rows of Arhar. In ZoneI, paired row planting of arhar and sesamum gives a higher return. In case pf paired row planting, two rows of arhar should be sown at 30 cm spacing followed by two rows of sesamum sown at 20 cm spacing. The seed rate and fertilizer doses  to the sesamum crop should be reduced to half of the recommended for pure sesamum crop.','Red Gram requires 35-40 cm water, during its entire growth period. Optimum moisture is necessary during (a) budding (b) flowering and (c) pod formation stages. As red gram is a rainfed crop grown in assured rainfall areas, usually it does not require any irrigation. If there is water stress, protective irrigation may be given in alternate rows at these 3 stages.',NULL),(11,'Bengal Gram','3','/IMG/crops/bengal_gram.jpg','Temperature:24 to 30 degree C.

Ready to harvest in 140-145 days. Gives average yield of 10-12 qtl/acre. G 130: Medium duration variety.','It can be grown on wide variety of soils. Sandy loam to clay loam  is considered to be most suitable soil for gram cultivation. Soil having water logging problem are not suitable for cultivation. Saline alkaline soil are not suitable. pH in the range 5.5 to 7 is ideal for sowing. Avoid sowing of same crop continuously in field. Follow proper crop rotation. Crop rotation with cereals help in controlling soil borne disease. Common rotation are kharif fallow-chick pea, kharif fallow-gram + wheat/barley/raya, Chari-gram, bajra-gram, rice/maize-gram.','Very fine and compact seedbed is not good for chick pea, it required rough seed bed. If it is cultivated as mix crop the land should be plough to fine tilth. If chick pea crop is taken after a kharif fellow carry out one deep ploughing during the monsoon as it will help to conserved rain water. Before sowing plough, the land only once. If soils appear to be deficient in moisture run a roller about a week before sowing.','Time of sowing: For rainfed conditions, complete sowing from Oct 10 to Oct 25. Under irrigated condition complete sowing from October 25 to November 10 of desi and kabuli varieties. Sowing on right time is necessary as early sowing leads to excessive vegetative growth, also crop get affected due to wilt while late sowing, crop make poor vegetative growth and inadequate root development. Seed should be spaced 10 cm apart allowing 30-40 cm between rows. The seed should be placed 10-12.5 cm deep. Pora method is used for sowing Bengal gram.','Irrigation facilities are available, give a pre-sowing irrigation. It will ensure proper germination and smooth crop growth. After then give second irrigation at time of pre-flowering and one at pod development stage. In case of early rain delay irrigation and give according to requirement. Heavy and excess irrigation enhanced vegetative growth and depresses grain yield. Also, it doesn’t tolerate water stagnation in field so provide proper drainage in field.',NULL),(12,'Green Gram (Moong)','3','/IMG/crops/green_gram.jpg','Best climate condition for green gram cultivation is warm humid and within a temperature range 25 – 35 degree C, with moderate rain of 85 to 100 cm, well distributed throughout its growing period of 100 days.

Castor crop requires a hot, dry climate with annual rainfall of 500-800 mm, of which 500-600 mm is needed during the first 3 months of crop growth. Castor is an ideal crop for marginal lands of the Dry Zone where it can be grown under both rainfed and irrigated conditions. This crop is sensitive to high humidity and high temperatures above 40 degree C and impacts the crop yield.',NULL,'Generally, Castor is cultivated in lands which are not suitable for commercial farming. Castor can come up well in soils that are not that fertile and soils having less annual rainfall. Castor seeds can be grown on a wide range of soils which are fairly deep and well drained. The most suitable soils for castor cultivation are deep, moderately fertile, with slightly acidic conditions and well drained sandy loam soils. The ideal soil pH of soils should be around 6 for better yield. However, it can be cultivated on soils with pH range 5 to 8.5.','Land preparation is an important task on Castor cultivation. Give 3 or 4 deep ploughing to loosen up the soil as this crop requires well pulverized 40cm deeo loose sub-soil for good seed germination. Land or seed bed should be weed free and any weeds from previous crops should be removed. The clods should be crushed by using a country plough or harrow with onset of monsoons.','Propagation of castor crop is done through seeds. Castor bean is usually planted just before the rainy season in the month of June. However, it can be cultivated throughout the year in areas where irrigation facility is available. The spacing adopted generally range from 90-120 cm between rows and 40-60 cm between plants in the row. The seed should be shown either by plough furrow or with a seed-drill or by hand-dibbling.','Rainfed crops don’t need any irrigation.

A temperature of 26 to 32 degree C appears to be the ideal for most of the varieties of soya-bean. Soil temperature of 16 degree C or above support rapid germination and vigorous seedling growth in soya-bean farming. A lower temperature may cause to delay the flowering. Day length is the key factor in the soya-bean varieties as they are short day plants. ','Best season to plant soya-bean from 3rd week of June to mid of July','Soya-bean requires well drained and fertile loamy soils with a pH range between 6 and 7.5 are most favourable for its cultivation. Saline soils and sodic inhibit germination of soya-bean seeds. water logging damages the crop, so it is mandatory to have good soil drainage in rainy season.','Land selection is very important in soya-bean farming as this will impact the overall production of soya-bean. The main land must not have been sown with soya-bean crop in the previous season to avoid volunteer plants that cause admixture. Land continuously cultivated with soya-bean may harbour with pathogen. So, these kinds of fields must be avoided. A soil with high organic matter defiantly helps in leading production of vigorous seed. The field should be made into ridges and furrows of 1 foot wide or beds and channels of 4 feet x 6 feet depending on cultivation practices followed.','The sowing in soya-bean farming should be done in lines 45cm-60cm apart with the help of seed driller or behind the plough. Plant to plant distance can be kept from 4cm to 5cm. The sowing depth of soya-bean seed should most be more than 3cm-4cm under ideal moisture conditions.','The soya-bean crop generally does not require any irrigation during kharif season.  But, if there were any a long drought at the time of pod filling, one irrigation would be required. During rainy season, make sure crop soil has proper drainage to avoid the water logging. Spring crop would require about 6 to 7 irrigations.',NULL),(19,'Sunflower','4','/IMG/crops/sunflower.jpg','The crop requires a cool climate during germination and seedling growth. Seedlings tolerate frosts moderately well until they reach the 4 to 6 leaf stage development. It requires warm weather from the seedling stage up to the flowering stage and warm and sunny days during flowering to maturity. High humidity accompanied by cloudy weather and rainfall at the time of flowering results in poor seed set. ','Sunflower is a photo-insensitive crop therefore, it takes about 80 to 90 days in kharif, 105 to 130 days in rubi and 100 to 110 days in the spring season. Sunflower can be done in any month of the year.','Sunflower can be grown on a wide range of soils and tolerates a moderate pH range and some salinity. It thrives best on deep loam soils with good drainage and irrigation facilities. The optimum range of soil pH for this crop is 6.5 to 8.5. It performs better than groundnut in heavy black cotton soils of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.','Sunflower is one crop in the case of which, the season of planting are not the limiting factors. Three to four ploughing and diskings are sufficient for preparing the land. Soil should be moist at least 10cm deep before sowing and this condition necessitates good soaking rains or irrigation before sowing. Seed rate is 8-10kg of well-filled seeds per hectare. For controlling seed-borne fungal diseases, seed treatment with either Brassical or Captan 3g per kg of seed is recommended. The pre-soaking of seed for 12-24 hours ensures a rapid and high percentage of germination, an early emergence and establishment of the crop. The seed is drilled at a depth of 5cm by adopting a spacing of 45cm between rows and 30cm between plants in the row.','The seed before sowing must be treated with Captan or Ceresan at the rate of 3g/kg of seed. Bold and certified seeds should be used. A seed rate of 8-10 kg/hectare is sufficient to ensure good crop stand, sunflower should be sown 60 cm apart in lines with a plant to plant spacing of 20 cm. The seed should be sown 3-4 cm depth for the better stand. Sowing can be done by corn planter in the furrows. After 10-12 days of germination, extra seedlings should be uprooted to provide a space of 20cm between plants in rows.','In sunflower farming, normally no irrigation is needed for kharif crop. However, one irrigation may be given in case of uneven distribution of rainfall. Rabi crop may be irrigated thrice after 40, 75 and 110 days of sowing. Sunflower crop is highly sensitive to water stress between flowering and grain filling stages. Therefore, one irrigation may be provided in case of moisture deficiency during this stage. Irrigation requirement of the crop during summer is relatively higher. Irrigation at the grain-filling stage should be light and given on calm and windless evening to avoid lodging. Among the various stages, bud initiation, flowering period and seed development stages are critical stages in terms of irrigation.',NULL),(20,'Safflower','4','/IMG/crops/safflower.jpg','The crop is grown during rabi primarily as a rainfed crop.

In addition, it can be cultivated anywhere from land on sea level to an altitude of up to 3300 meters. Places with a cool, moist weather for most part of the year followed by a short, dry and warm spell is most suited for wheat cultivation. This type of weather condition permits appropriate maturing and ripening of grains. However, areas with heavy rainfall, moist and warm climate are not suited for commercial wheat farming. Similarly, drought-like conditions, extremely low or high temperatures during the flowering stage would affect the wheat crop. During high temperature, a lot of energy is lost owing to transpiration. Hence, there is very little residual energy left within the crop resulting in low yields. High humidity and low temperature are likely to induce rust attack on the crops.','Wheat is a Rabi crop that is grown in the winter season. Sowing of wheat takes place in October to December and harvesting is done during the months of February and May. The wheat crop needs cool winters and hot summers, which is why the fertile plains of the Indo-Gangetic region are the most conducive for growing it.','Wheat needs soil with a moderate amount of water holding capacity. Being very sensitive to water logging, heavy soils with poor drainage capacity is not preferred for wheat cultivation. Generally, black cotton soil with good drainage capacity and a neutral pH is preferred for cultivation. If wheat is grown as a dry crop heavy soil with a good drainage capacity is preferred. On the contrary, soil with moderate drainage capacity is preferred for wheat as irrigated crop. The soil used for wheat cultivation must be free from coarse sand, gravel, stones, have a uniform texture and should be deep. It must be soft enough to permit deeper root penetration.','One of the primary requirements of wheat cultivation is that the soil must be free of clods, stones, sand and gravel. Hence, the land must be ploughed at least 3 times during summer before cultivation. The residual crop debris can be burnt in the field itself. Following this the land must be harrowed again during the rainy season to prevent growth of wild plants and weeds. After this heavy harrowing, a light harrowing is done wherein the rots and stubble are removed. This step is conducted immediately before sowing. However, in case of irrigated crop, the land is not ploughed as many times. Irrigation is done before sowing so that there is adequate amount of moisture when sowing is done.','Before sowing, the seeds are treated with 5-gram Trichoderma spores or 5 Kg carbendazim for every 1 Kg seed. Wheat seeds are also given solar treatment so as to avoid diseases like wheat smut on the crop. There should be a space of 15- 20 cm maintained between the seeds. In case of late sowing the seeds must be soaked overnight in water. Shallow sowing must be done and it should be covered with a thin layer of farm yard manure.','Flood irrigation is the most common type of irrigation followed. Although irrigation is needed only once in every 10 days, it is done only once in every 15 days in case black soil is used for cultivation. On an average about 6-7 irrigation cycles are needed for wheat since they are ready for harvest within 120 days. In other words, irrigation is provided at the most crucial stages like crown root initiation, leaf growth development (tillering), Jointing Stage which is the most critical stage as it provides evidence that plants have initiated the reproductive phase, Flowering stage, Ripening stage and Maturity stage',NULL);
